On May 20, 1941, the skies over the island of Crete darkened with parachutes as Nazi Germany launched Operation Mercury. Though the Battle of Crete would ultimately end in German occupation, its legacy looms large in Greek memory, far outweighing its tactical value in the broader context of World War II.

For over a week, elite German paratroopers met unexpectedly fierce resistance from Commonwealth troops—primarily British, Australian, and New Zealander forces—alongside Cretan civilians. Poorly armed and often using hunting rifles, knives, and even farming tools, the local population rose against the invaders with remarkable bravery. This spontaneous and spirited civilian resistance took the Germans by surprise, disrupting their carefully coordinated plans and inflicting heavy casualties.

Despite their initial setbacks, the Germans eventually secured the island, largely due to superior air power and the eventual breakdown of Allied communication and supply lines. The controversial leadership decisions of figures such as New Zealand’s General Bernard Freyberg have been scrutinized, particularly regarding his hesitance to counterattack at critical moments and his overreliance on flawed intelligence. These missteps contributed to the Allied defeat and the evacuation of thousands of soldiers.

What followed the German victory was a campaign of brutal reprisals. The Wehrmacht, enraged by the civilian resistance -which they viewed as illegal under the laws of war- responded with mass executions, village burnings, and widespread atrocities against the Cretan population. Entire communities, such as Kandanos, were razed and their inhabitants slaughtered.

To this day, no comprehensive justice has been served for these war crimes. The German commanders responsible, including General Kurt Student, largely escaped accountability, with only light sentences or early releases. This failure of justice has left a deep scar in the collective memory of the Cretan people.
