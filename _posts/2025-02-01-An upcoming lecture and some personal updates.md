 After successfully defending my Ph.D. thesis, I took some time to reconnect with my initial research interests, particularly military history. This period of reflection was invaluable as I navigated my next career steps and rekindled my passion for the field.
I’m thrilled to share that this journey has been rewarding—three of my recent articles have been accepted in high-ranking journals, and my latest book is set to be published in the coming months.
In addition, I’m honored to be giving a virtual lecture for the RAF Museum this June. My talk will explore the battle for Maleme Airfield in 1941, drawing from two years of extensive archival research. A huge thank you to the organizers for this opportunity!
