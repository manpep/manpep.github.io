Hydra, Spetses, and Psara islands were developed as commercial centers in the 18th century. After the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, several ships of these islands took advantage of the right to sail under the Russian flag. During the Napoleonic Wars, several sailors became rich, trading grain in British-blockaded Europe. This prompted them to equip themselves and become skilled warriors to face potential pirate raids.

On the eve of the Greek Revolution, the three islands had a fleet of about 200 ships. The people of Spetses were the first to rise on March 26, 1821. About twenty of their ships opened in the Aegean, immediately capturing two Ottoman ships and obtaining booty from raids. Soon after, a local council was created within the island, and a constitution was established. The contribution of the people of Spetses in the conflict was important, especially for the liberation of Nafplio, Monemvasia, and Neokastro.

In Hydra, skepticism prevailed. Only after the intervention of warriors from Psara and Spetses, did the local authorities decide to participate in the revolution (April 14) and send ships against the Ottomans of Corinth. On the other hand, the Psara's contribution to the revolution was immediate. Rising on April 11, revolutionaries from this island raided the Asia Minor coast and captured enemy ships carrying soldiers. A resident of the island, Ioannis Patatoukos seems to have been the one who taught the rest of the islanders how to turn their boats into small fireships. Soon, the passage to the Northern Aegean became dangerous for the Ottoman Fleet.

Of course, there was no lack of deviations. Often, the looting by the Spetses’ and Psara’s fleets was indiscriminate, with their victims being Christians who simply happened to be in their way. However, the revolution would have failed without the ships of these three naval islands.
