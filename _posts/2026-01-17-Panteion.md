Yesterday marked my final lecture at Panteion University. It was a genuine pleasure to engage with a group of highly motivated and intellectually curious students, and I am confident that their professional and academic futures will be bright.

Throughout the course, my aim was to address not only key aspects of contemporary Balkan history and Greek–Albanian relations, but also broader academic competencies: how to write rigorous scholarly texts, the growing role of technology in the humanities, and the vital connections between history and international relations.

Teaching at Panteion University has been a particularly meaningful experience, as it was my first time teaching at a Greek university. It proved to be both intellectually rewarding and personally enriching. As this chapter comes to a close, I look ahead with enthusiasm and readiness for a new beginning.
