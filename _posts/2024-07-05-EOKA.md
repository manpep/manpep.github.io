This year marks the 70th anniversary of the beginning of EOKA’s armed struggle in Cyprus, a pivotal chapter in modern history. From 1955 to 1959, Greek Cypriot insurgents frequently clashed with British colonial forces, with their actions ultimately contributing to the signing of the Zurich-London Agreements.

To commemorate this anniversary, on Saturday, April 12, 2025, I’ll have the pleasure of speaking with Andrew R. Novo at De Profundis Bookstore (73 Zoodochou Pigis St., Athens) about his new book EOKA 1955–1959: The Struggle for Union. The book will be released in the coming days by Govostis Publications, and I believe it will significantly influence how we approach the Cyprus Question in contemporary discourse. The event will be open to the public, and I’d be delighted to connect in person with anyone interested in this important topic.

At the same time, the April issue of the magazine Military History features a special tribute to the operations of EOKA. Among several insightful articles by fellow historians, you’ll find my own contribution, which explores the impact of the April 1st attacks in Athens, London, and Nicosia—a date marking the launch of the armed campaign.

Finally, I must confess a personal admiration for the work of Andreas Kariou on the military dimensions of the Cypriot struggle. His doctoral dissertation, EOKA, 1955–1959: A Study of the Military Aspects of the Cyprus Revolt, along with his subsequent articles, shed light on many lesser-known aspects of the conflict. I wholeheartedly recommend his writings to anyone interested in military history or seeking to deepen their understanding of Cyprus’s turbulent mid-20th-century past.
