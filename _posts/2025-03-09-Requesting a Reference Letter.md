Every semester, I receive multiple requests for reference letters. If you're considering reaching out to me for one, please take a moment to read this.

First and foremost, I consider it an honor to support my students and colleagues in advancing their careers. If I can genuinely contribute to your next step, I am happy to do so.

However, please do not request a reference letter from me if:

1) You have engaged in discriminatory behavior in my classroom. I cannot support individuals who express sexism, racism, homophobia, or any form of discrimination.
2) You have been flagged for academic dishonesty, including the misuse of AI to cheat.
3) My knowledge of your work is not relevant to the position or program you are applying for. A strong reference should come from someone who can meaningfully speak to your qualifications.

If none of these apply to you and you believe I can provide a strong, relevant endorsement, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d be happy to help.
