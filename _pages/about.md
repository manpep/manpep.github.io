Hi! My name is Emmanouil (or "Manolis") Peponas, and I was born in Athens, Greece, in 1995. After a non-promising basketball career as a youngster, I decided to follow an even more unstable career pathway and be a historian. And seriously, I never regret it. 
I hold a BA in History, a BA in Philosophy, an MA in Modern and Contemporary History (University of Ioannina), and a Ph.D. in Contemporary Greek History (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens). During my studies, I was awarded three scholarships for my academic excellence. Additionally, I have worked as a freelance author, researcher, and editor for remarkable institutions and companies for over a decade. Apart from my scholarly activities, several articles are addressed to the public and published in magazines, sites, and newspapers. I am also the author of five books - none of them is a best-seller.
In my free time, I practice kickboxing and calisthenics (or watch hilarious videos with dogs on YouTube). 
I state that I write "sine ira et studio," but no one believes me.  

On this website, you can find more about what I'm up to, explore my latest publications, and delve into topics that interest me. Occasionally, I'll share my thoughts or anything intriguing that captures my attention. Stay tuned for regular updates and engaging content!
