excerpt: 'The defending of Crete by the Commonwealth troops was one of the most crucial moments of World War II. On this island, in 1941, Australians, New Zealanders, Greeks, and British soldiers faced the elite Hitler's paratroopers. The result of the conflict determined by Churchill's decisions, as well as the tactical mistakes of the commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division, General Bernard Freyberg. This paper aims to illuminate unknown aspects of the British Prime Minister's actions and present his experiences during the battle.'
